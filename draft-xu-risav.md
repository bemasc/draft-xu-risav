--- abstract

This document presents RISAV, a protocol for establishing and using IPsec security between Autonomous Systems (ASes) using the RPKI identity system. In this protocol, the originating AS adds authenticating information to each outgoing packet at its Border Routers (ASBRs), and the receiving AS verifies and strips this information at its ASBRs. Packets that fail validation are dropped by the ASBR. RISAV achieves Source Address Validation among all participating ASes.

# Introduction

Source address spoofing has been identified years ago at {{RFC2827}}, and {{RFC5210}} has proposed an Source Address Validation Architecture (SAVA) to alleviate such concerns. SAVA classifies this solution into three layers: Access Network, Intra-AS, and Inter-AS. The Inter-AS concerns the SAV at the AS boundaries. It is more challenging for developing the inter-AS source address validation approach because different ASes run different policies in different ISPs independently. It requires the different ASes to collaborate to verify the source address. The inter-AS SAV is more effective than Access or Intra-AS due to its better cost-effectiveness. However, over years of effort, inter-AS source address validation deployment is still not optimistic. An important reason is the difficulty of balancing the clear security benefits of partial implementations with the scalability of large-scale deployments. uRPF {{RFC5635}} {{RFC8704}}, for example, is a routing-based schemes filter spoofing source address's traffic, which may result in a lack of security benefits due to the dynamic nature of routing or incomplete information caused by partial deployments.

This document provides a static-static ECDH {{RFC6278}}, RPKI {{RFC6480}} and IPsec-based {{RFC4301}} inter-AS approach to source address validation (RISAV). RISAV is a cryptography-based SAV mechanism to reduce the spoofing source address. It combines static-static ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman key Exchange), RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure), and IPsec (IP Security). RPKI provides the reflection relationship between AS numbers (ASN) and IP prefixes. ECDH negotiates between two ASes with the Security Association (SA) which contains the algorithm, secret key generating material, and IPsec packet type, and so forth. IPsec is designed for secure the Internet at the IP layer. It introduces two protocols, one is AH (authentication header) {{RFC4302}} which provides authenticity of the whole packet, including the source address. The other is ESP (IP Encapsulating Security Payload) {{RFC4303}} which encrypts the whole packet's payload.

# Overview

The goal of this section is to provides the high level description of what RISAV is and how RISAV works.

## What RISAV Is

RISAV is a cryptographically-based inter-AS source address validation approach that guarantees security benefits at partial deployment. It aims to provide the IP datagram with a valid source address, with the capability of anti-spoofing, anti-replay, light-weight and efficient, and incremental deployment incentives. As a result, RISAV adds a tag to a packet at the source AS Border Router (ASBR) proving that the packet is with a valid source address, and it would verify and remove this tag at the destination ASBR. The tag will be encapsulated in the Integrity Check Value (ICV) field of IPsec AH/ESP.

## How RISAV Works

RISAV uses static-static ECDH as an alternative of IKE {{RFC8247}} to negotiate the security association (SA) used in IPsec AH/ESP communications. Otherwise, it MUST follow strictly the standard IKE process to negotiate IKE SA and IPsec SA. RPKI obtains the binding relationship between AS numbers and IP prefixes, and it will synchronize the public key generated by ECDH and other messages including the contact IP to all peers. And the original IPsec AH/ESP header format is used in communication to carry this tag. The transport mode of IPsec AH is applied in general.

Before deploying RISAV, each AS sets a contact IP representative. When negotiating or consulting with one AS, the peer MUST first communicate with this contact IP. This contact IP should contain at least and at most two IPs: one is IPv4 and the other is IPv6. In short, these are referred to as contact IP below.

A typical workflow of RISAV is shown in {{figure1}}.

1. RPKI process. The five Reginal Internet Registry (RIR) would be authorized by IANA. They use their root certificate to sign the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate of the Local Internet Registry (LIR). And after that LIR would use a CA certificate to authorize indirectly the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or directly the Autonomous System (AS). When they obtain their own CA certificate, the AS would sign an End Entity (EE) certificate with a Route Origin Authorisation (ROA) which is a cryptographically signed object that states which AS are authorized to originate a certain prefix. Such the reflection of the ASN relationship with IP prefixes would be broadcast to the network. This is the prerequisite.

2. ECDH key exchange. The two deployed ASes MUST carry out the ECDH procedure to exchange public key and store the secretly private key with each contact IP. Then the AS encapsulates its public key in PKCS#10 syntax {{RFC2986}} to request a CA certificate with its contact IP. The contact IP will also be reserved at the relative CA certificate issued to one AS. After this exchange process, the AS pair negotiate immediately the algorithm, the IPsec header type, the session key and other fields at the Security Association Database (SAD).

3. ASBR EE certificate signing. The ASBR would need its own EE certificate for and only for generating and verifying the ICV field in the AH/ESP header. This EE certificate is REQUIRED like the BGPsec Router Certificate defined in {{RFC8209}}. But the key used in generating the ICV value is not directly using this ECDH key pair. The key will be generated at the step 4 next. Since the ASBR is the main entity that processes the tag in the packet, it MUST be clear that all ASBRs of the same AS at the same time should apply the same key to calculate the ICV value. Thus, this will eliminate the multipath problems, which will be discussed in {{MPProblem}}.

4. RPKI and information synchronization. The ROA synchronization would take place after the RPKI is deployed as step 1 describes. Here it will synchronize the contact IP in the RPKI database. That means the contact IP should be an exposed-available, high-performance IP address. After syncrhonization, the ASBR would get the IP address of the contact IP. The ASBR also requires that the synchronization includes the session key and other things negotiated at the step 2 used in the IPsec communication.

5. SA negotiation and delivery. This is an OPTIONAL operation only if the AS doesn't support static-static ECDH. Before IPsec is established, the SA must be reached an agreement. There are two ways to negotiate the SA in traditional IPsec. One is manually config all the parameters and the other one is using IKE for dynamic negotiating these parameters. Currently used is IKE version 2 (IKEv2, for short using IKE below). Typically, IKE would produce IKE SA in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange and IPsec SA in the IKE_AUTH exchange. This will be done at the entity that owns and uses the contact IP, i.e. IKE node should be the node with the contact IP. When all negotiations are done, the IPsec is established.

6. IPsec communication. It uses IPsec AH for authentication of the IP source address by default. IPsec is often used in tunnel mode as the IPsec VPN. Here, It expands the gateway to the ASBR. When two ends x and y in AS A and B respectively are communicating, the packet from x arriving at its ASBR RA would use the established IPsec channel for adding the representative tag which is generated with the negotiated and synchronized algorithm, session key, IPsec type, and other items and is filled in the ICV field. After the packet arrives at ASBR RB of AS B, it would be inspected by comparing the consistency of the tag at the packet's ICV field and the tag generated in the same way at the source ASBR.



# Control Plane

The functions of the control plane of RISAV include ASN-Prefix relationship announcement, Tag management, and ASN-Tag relationship announcement.

## ASN-Prefix relationship announcement

RISAV uses RPKI to manage the relationship between ASN and IP prefixes. So when one AS wants to deploy RISAV, it should implement RPKI first. When RPKI is deployed, the validated ROA cache SHOULD be sent to the ASBR for routing and forwarding packets.

The ROA whose status is valid can be used with IPsec to prevent source address spoofing. That means only the prefix contained in valid ROA would valuably and correctly be protected.

For more information about RPKI, one can refer to {{RFC6480}}.

## Tag management

Before introducing the ASN-Tag relationship announcement, it shall be described what is a tag and how it is generated.

A tag is a variable bit-string that is generated at an entity in AS. This entity is AS Control Server (ACS). The tag is used with the authentication algorithm to generate the signature. That means the tag is the key to the authentication. When communicating, the tag would not be directly tagged to the IPsec AH of the packet, replacing it with a signature instead, which will be different with different packets. One AS SHOULD have at most two tags in effect in the same bound simultaneously for Key-Rover.

It has two ways for an ACS to generate tags. One is using a state machine. The state machine runs and triggers the state transition when time is up. The tag is generated in the process of state transition as the side product. The two ACS in peer AS respectively before data transmission will maintain one state machine pair for each bound. The state machine runs simultaneously after the initial state, state transition algorithm, and state transition interval are negotiated, thus they generate the same tag at the same time. Time triggers state transition which means the ACS MUST synchronize the time to the same time base using like NTP defined in {{RFC5905}}.

The other way to generate a tag is by applying the original SA. The IPsec channel is established when the IKE_AUTH process is finished. SA includes the specified AH, the authentication algorithm, the key used for authentication, etc. So two IKE entities have negotiated SA. All ASBR in one AS SHOULD use the same SA.

When it chooses to use a logical ACS, one AS will elect one distinguished ASBR as the ACS. The distinguished ASBR acting as an ACS will represent the whole AS to communicate with peer AS's ACS. This election takes place prior to the IKE negotiation. An ASBR MUST be a BGP speaker before it is elected as the distinguished ASBR. This is an OPTIONAL operation to use this logical ACS.

## ASN-Tag relationship announcement

Corresponding to the tag generating, it also has two ways to announce the ASN-Tag binding relationship. The first is to deliver the generated tags and the second is to deliver the original SA.

Thus, there must be a header format definition to transfer these tags and SA. In RISAV, it uses the header and payload formats defined in {{RFC5996}}. Meanwhile, there are some almost negligible changes to the formats. For the tag generation method, it MUST be to specify the initial state and initial state length of the state machine, the identifier of a state machine, state transition interval, length of generated Tag, and Tag. For the SA, they will transfer all these payloads in a secure channel between ACS and ASBRs, for instance, in ESP {{RFC4303}}. It is RECOMMENDED to transfer the tags rather than the SA for security and efficiency considerations. The initial state and its length can be specified at the Key Exchange Payload with nothing to be changed. The state machine identifier is the SPI value as the SPI value is uniquely in RISAV. The state transition interval and length of generated Tag should be negotiated by the pair ACS, which will need to allocate one SA attribute. The generated Tag will be sent from ACS to ASBR in a secure channel which MAY be, for example, ESP {{RFC4303}}.

# Data Plane

The functions of the data plane of RISAV include source address checking and tag processing.

RISAV redesign the original AH format as shown in {{fig2}}.

{: #fig2 title="RISAV AH Format."}

Prefix Length:
: The prefix length in valid ROA matched the IP source address. It presents the valid length of the IP source address prefix.

SIG Length:
: The length of the variable signature. It is the octets in Signature.

Signature:
: The result of the authentication algorithm with the key.

All the ASBRs of the AS are REQUIRED to enable RISAV. And RISAV can OPTIONAL cooperate with intra-domain SAV and access-layer SAV, such as {{RFC8704}} or SAVI {{RFC7039}}. Only when intra-domain or access-layer SAV, if deployed, check passed can the packet process and forward correctly. It uses SPI for destination ASBR to locate the SA uniquely when processing the AH header in RISAV.

As defined in {{RFC4301}}, the Security Association Database (SAD) stores all the SAs. One data item in SAD includes an Authentication algorithm and corresponding key when AH is supported. The authentication algorithm could be HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, or others. As authenticating the whole packet causes a heavy burden in the computation, RISAV defines that it only authenticates the IP source address, IP destination address, and the IP prefix length in ROA, SPI, and Sequence Number Field. The eventual signature is the hash of the 5-tuple before with the key/tag.

When a packet arrives at the source ASBR, it will be checked with the destination address by this ASBR first. If the destination address is in the protection range of RISAV, the packet will be checked by the source address next. If the source address belongs to the AS in which the ASBR locates, the packet needs to be filled in the AH header.

When a packet arrives at the destination ASBR, it will be checked the destination address and the source address orderly. If the destination belongs to the AS that the destination ASBR locates in and the source address seats in the RISAV protection area, the packet needs to be inspected with the AH header.

## Incremental deployment

So far, IPsec is often used as a VPN which is a technology for private network access through public networks. In the final analysis, IPsec is a highly cost-effective ratio mechanism. Original IPsec AH needs to authenticate the whole constant part of a packet so that it needs to spend amounts of time finding and processing unchangeable fields in the packet. However, RISAV only needs to find a few changeless fields to authenticate the packet decreasing the cost dramatically.

# Security Consideration

<!-- TODO: I don't think NAT is necesarry inter-AS as all the outter IP header should be the unicast IP address
## NAT scenario
As RISAV is used in
-->

## Multipath Problem {#MPProblem}
<!-- TODO: this is the problem that requires one AS should be logically presented as one entity. That means all ASBRs of one AS should be acted like one ASBR.
-->

## Compatibility

When using RISAV, it WOULD be used at last when all other IPsec SA does not match. Such that, RISAV is comparable with the current IPsec Security Architecture. It SHOULD be guaranteed that the preference of RISAV is lower than other IPsec. So it may require the special SPI filled.

## Key Guessing and Cracking

For resisting label-based reply attacks, the eventual signature used in a packet is generated by the ASBR by hashing a few fields including the IP source address, IP destination address, and the IP prefix length in ROA, SPI, and Sequence Number Field. The attacker could guess the signature and crack that key using brute force. Nevertheless, it depends on the irreversibility of a hash function to prevent back stepping the key from the signature. Furthermore, to decrease such probability, the key used in generating the signature will be updated periodically.
