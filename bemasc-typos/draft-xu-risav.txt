An RPKI and IPsec-based AS-to-AS Approach for Source Address Validation
                         draft-xu-risav-latest

Abstract

   This document presents RISAV, a protocol for establishing and using
   IPsec security between Autonomous Systems (ASes) using the RPKI
   identity system.  In this protocol, the originating AS adds
   authenticating information to each outgoing packet at its Border
   Routers (ASBRs), and the receiving AS verifies and strips this
   information at its ASBRs.  Packets that fail validation are dropped
   by the ASBR.  RISAV achieves Source Address Validation among all
   participating ASes.

1.  Introduction

   Source address spoofing is the practice of using a source IP address
   without proper authorization from its owner.  The basic internet
   routing architecture does not provide any defense against spoofing,
   so any system can send packets that claim any source address.  This
   practice enables a variety of attacks, most notably volumetric DoS
   attacks as discussed in [RFC2827].

   There are many possible approaches to preventing address spoofing.
   Section 2.1 of [RFC5210] describes three classes of Source Address
   Validation (SAV): Access Network, Intra-AS, and Inter-AS.  Inter-AS
   SAV is the most challenging class, because different ASes have
   different policies and operate independently.  Inter-AS SAV requires
   the different ASes to collaborate to verify the source address.
   However, in the absence of total trust between all ASes, Inter-AS SAV
   is a prerequisite to defeat source address spoofing.

   Despite years of effort, current Inter-AS SAV protocols are not
   widely deployed.  An important reason is the difficulty of balancing
   the clear security benefits of partial implementations with the
   scalability of large-scale deployments. uRPF [RFC5635] [RFC8704], for
   example, is a routing-based scheme that filters out spoofed traffic.
   In cases where the routing is dynamic or unknown, uRPF deployments
   must choose between false negatives (i.e. incomplete SAV) and false
   positives (i.e. broken routing).

   This document provides an RPKI- [RFC6480] and IPsec-based [RFC4301]
   approach to inter-AS source address validation (RISAV).  RISAV is a
   cryptography-based SAV mechanism to reduce the spoofing of source
   addresses.  In RISAV, the RPKI database acts as a root of trust for
   IPsec between participating ASes.  Each pair of ASes uses IKEv2 to
   negotiate an IPsec Security Association (SA).  Packets between those
   ASes are then protected by a modified IPsec Authentication Header
   (AH) [RFC4302] or an Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)[RFC4303].
   IPsec authenticates the source address, allowing spoofed packets to
   be dropped at the border of the receiving AS.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   Commonly used terms in this document are described below.

   ACS:  AS Contact Server, which is the logical representative of one
      AS and is responsible for delivering session keys and other
      information to ASBR.

   Contact IP:  The IP address of the ACS.

   ASBR:  AS border router, which is at the boundary of an AS.

   SAV:  Source Address Validation, which verifies the source address of
      an IP packet and guarantee the source address is valid.

2.  Overview

   The goal of this section is to provides the high level description of
   what RISAV is and how RISAV works.

2.1.  What RISAV Is

   RISAV is a cryptographically-based inter-AS source address validation
   protocol that provides clear security benefits even at partial
   deployment.  It aims to prove that each IP datagram was sent from
   inside the AS that owns its source address, defeating spoofing and
   replay attacks.  It is light-weight and efficient, and provides
   incremental deployment incentives.

   At the source AS Border Router, RISAV adds a MAC to each packet that
   proves ownership of the packet's source address.  At the recipient's
   ASBR, RISAV verifies and removes this MAC, recovering the unmodified
   original packet.  The MAC is delivered in the Integrity Check Value
   (ICV) field of a modified IPsec AH, or as part of the normal IPsec
   ESP payload.

2.2.  How RISAV Works

   RISAV uses IKEv2 to negotiate an IPsec security association (SA)
   between any two ASes.  RPKI provides the binding relationship between
   AS numbers, IP ranges, contact IPs, and public keys.  After
   negotiation, all packets between these ASes are secured by use of a
   modified AH header or a standard ESP payload.

   Before deploying RISAV, each AS sets a contact IP representative.
   When negotiating or consulting with one AS, the peer MUST first
   communicate with this contact IP.  The AS MUST publish exactly one
   contact IP for each supported address family (i.e.  IPv4 and/or IPv6)
   in the RPKI database.

   A typical workflow of RISAV is shown in Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: RISAV workflow example.

   1.  RPKI process.  The five Regional Internet Registries (RIR),
       authorized by IANA, use their root certificate to sign the
       Certificate Authority (CA) certificate of the Local Internet
       Registry (LIR), which is used to authorize the Autonomous System
       (AS)(sometimes indirectly via the Internet Service Provider
       (ISP)).  When they obtain their own CA certificate, the AS would
       sign an End Entity (EE) certificate with a Route Origin
       Authorisation (ROA) which is a cryptographically signed object
       that states which AS are authorized to originate a certain
       prefix.  This authenticated binding of the ASN to its IP prefixes
       is published in the RPKI database.  This is a prerequisite for
       RISAV.

   2.  ACS EE certificate provisioning.  The ACS would need its own EE
       certificate for IKEv2.  This EE certificate is REQUIRED like the
       BGPsec Router Certificate defined in [RFC8209].

   3.  RISAV announcement.  Each participating AS announces its support
       for RISAV in the RPKI database, including the IP address of its
       ACS (the "contact IP").

   4.  SA negotiation and delivery.  The ACSes negotiate an SA using
       IKEv2.  After synchronization, all ASBRs would get the SA,
       including the session key and other parameters.

   5.  IPsec communication.  RISAV uses IPsec AH (i.e. "transport mode")
       for authentication of the IP source address by default.  When an
       ASBR in AS A sends a packet to AS B, it uses the established
       IPsec channel to add the required AH header.  The ASBR in AS B
       validates the AH header to ensure that the packet was not
       spoofed, and removes the header.

3.  Control Plane

   The functions of the control plane of RISAV include:

   *  Announcing that this AS supports RISAV.

   *  Publishing contact IPs.

   *  Performing IPsec session initialization (i.e.  IKEv2).

   These functions are achieved in two steps.  First, each participating
   AS publishes a Signed Object [RFC6488] in its RPKI Repository
   containing a RISAVAnnouncement:

   RISAVAnnouncement ::= SEQUENCE {
            version [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
            asID ASID,
            contactIP ipAddress,
            testing BOOLEAN }

   When a participating AS discovers another participating AS (via its
   regular sync of the RPKI database), it initiates an IKEv2 handshake
   between its own contact IP and the other AS's contact IP.  This
   handshake MUST include an IKE_AUTH exchange that authenticates both
   ASes with their RPKI ROA certificates.

   Once this handshake is complete, each AS MUST activate RISAV on all
   outgoing packets, and SHOULD drop all non-RISAV traffic from the
   other AS after a reasonable grace period (e.g. 60 seconds).

   The "testing" field indicates whether this contact IP is potentially
   unreliable.  When this field is set to true, other ASes MUST fall
   back to ordinary operation if IKE negotiation fails.  Otherwise, the
   contact IP is presumed to be fully reliable, and other ASes SHOULD
   drop all non-RISAV traffic from this AS if IKE negotiation fails (see
   Section 6.1.2).

   For more information about RPKI, see [RFC6480].

3.1.  Disabling RISAV

   To disable RISAV, a participating AS MUST perform the following steps
   in order:

   1.  Stop requiring RISAV authentication of incoming packets.

   2.  Remove the RISAVAnnouncement from the RPKI Repository.

   3.  Wait at least 24 hours.

   4.  Stop sending RISAV and shut down the contact IP.

   Conversely, if any AS no longer publishes a RISAVAnnouncement, other
   ASes MUST immediately stop sending RISAV to that AS, but MUST NOT
   delete any negotiated Tunnel Mode SAs for at least 24 hours, in order
   to continue to process encrypted incoming traffic.

      TODO: Discuss changes to the contact IP, check if there are any
      race conditions between activation and deactivation, IKEv2
      handshakes in progress, SA expiration, etc.

      SA has its own expiration time and IKE has its keepalive
      mechanism.  In abnormal case, i.e. the connection is failed after
      the IKE handshake is established, SA will be always in effect
      during its lifetime until it expires or the IKE keepalive is
      failed.  In normal case, i.e. the connection is actively down, SA
      will be expired and RISAV will be disabled immediately.

      OPEN QUESTION: Does IKEv2 have an authenticated permanent
      rejection option that would help here?

4.  Data Plane

   All the ASBRs of the AS are REQUIRED to enable RISAV.  The
   destination ASBR uses the IPsec SPI to locate the correct SA.

   As defined in [RFC4301], the Security Association Database (SAD)
   stores all the SAs.  Each data item in the SAD includes a
   cryptographic algorithm (e.g.  HMAC-SHA-256), its corresponding key,
   and other relevant parameters.

   When an outgoing packet arrives at the source ASBR, its treatment
   depends on the source and destination address.  If the source address
   belongs to the AS in which the ASBR is located, and the destination
   address is in an AS for which the ASBR has an active RISAV SA, then
   the packet needs to be modified for RISAV.

   The modification that is applied depends on whether IPsec "transport
   mode" or "tunnel mode" is active.  This is determined by the presence
   or absence of the USE_TRANSPORT_MODE notification in the IKEv2
   handshake.  RISAV implementations MUST support transport mode, and
   MAY support tunnel mode.

      OPEN QUESTION: How do peers express a preference or requirement
      for transport or tunnel mode?

   When a packet arrives at the destination ASBR, it will check the
   destination address and the source address.  If the destination
   belongs to the AS in which the destination ASBR is located, and the
   source address is in an AS with which this AS has an active RISAV SA,
   then the packet is subject to RISAV processing.

   To avoid DoS attacks, participating ASes MUST drop any outgoing
   packet to the contact IP of another AS.  Only the AS operator's
   systems (i.e. the ACS and ASBRs) are permitted to send packets to the
   contact IPs of other ASes.  ASBRs MAY drop inbound packets to the
   contact IP from non-participating ASes.

4.1.  Transport Mode

   To avoid conflict with other uses of IPsec (Section 6.3.1), RISAV
   defines its own variant of the IPsec Authentication Header (AH).  The
   RISAV-AH header format is shown in Figure 2.

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Next Header   |  Payload Len  |           RESERVED            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 Security Parameters Index (SPI)               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 Integrity Check Value (ICV)                   |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 2: RISAV-AH Format.

   This format is identical to IPsec standard AH except that the
   Sequence Number is omitted, because RISAV is presumed to be a "multi-
   sender SA" for which anti-replay defense is not supported ([RFC4302],
   Section 2.5).  This change saves 8 octets when the ICV is 16, 24, or
   32 octets.  For a 16-octet ICV (most common), RISAV-AH adds 24 octets
   to each packet.

   The RISAV-AH header is only for AS-to-AS communication.  ASes MUST
   strip off all RISAV-AH headers for packets whose destination is
   inside the AS, even if the AS is not currently inspecting the ICV
   values.

   In transport mode, each AS's SA Database (SAD) is indexed by SPI and
   counterpart AS, regardless of the source and destination IPs.

4.2.  Tunnel Mode

   In tunnel mode, a RISAV sender ASBR wraps each outgoing packet in an
   ESP payload.  Each ASBR uses its own source address, and sets the
   destination address to the contact IP of the destination AS.

   The contact IP decrypts all IPsec traffic to recover the original
   packets, which are forwarded to the correct destination.  After
   decryption, the receiving AS MUST check that the source IP and
   destination IP are in the same AS as the outer source and
   destination, respectively.

   In tunnel mode, each ASBR maintains its own copy of the SA Database
   (SAD).  Each copy of the SAD is indexed by SPI and counterpart AS.
   If a valid ESP packet is received from an unknown IP address, the
   receiving AS SHOULD allocate a new replay defense window, subject to
   resource constraints.  This allows replay defense to work as usual.
   (If the contact IP is implemented as an ECMP cluster, effective
   replay defense may require consistent hashing.)

   Tunnel mode imposes a space overhead of 73 octets in IPv6.

      PROBLEM: ESP doesn't protect the source IP, so a packet could be
      replayed by changing the source IP.  Can we negotiate an extension
      to ESP that covers the IP header?  Or could we always send from
      the contact IP and encode the ASBR ID in the low bits of the SPI?

5.  Possible Extensions

   This section presents potential additions to the design.

      TODO: Remove this section once we have consensus on whether these
      extensions are worthwhile.

5.1.  Header-only authentication

   RISAV-AH, like standard IPsec AH, authenticates the whole constant
   part of a packet, including the entire payload.  To improve
   efficiency, we could define an IKE parameter to negotiate a header-
   only variant of transport mode that only authenticates the IP source
   address, IP destination address, etc.

   This would likely result in a 10-30x decrease in cryptographic cost
   compared to standard IPsec.  However, it would also offer no SAV
   defense against any attacker who can view legitimate traffic.  An
   attacker who can read a single authenticated packet could simply
   replace the payload, allowing it to issue an unlimited number of
   spoofed packets.

5.2.  Time-based key rotation

   Each IKEv2 handshake negotiates a fixed shared secret, known to both
   parties.  In some cases, it might be desirable to rotate the shared
   secret frequently:

   *  In transport mode, frequent rotation would limit how long a single
      packet can be replayed by a spoofing attacker.

   *  If the ASBRs are less secure than the ACS, frequent rotation could
      limit the impact of a compromised ASBR.

   However, increasing the frequency of IKEv2 handshakes would increase
   the burden on the ACS.  One alternative possibility is to use a state
   machine.  The state machine runs and triggers the state transition
   when time is up.  The tag is generated in the process of state
   transition as the side product.  The two ACS in peer AS respectively
   before data transmission will maintain one state machine pair for
   each bound.  The state machine runs simultaneously after the initial
   state, state transition algorithm, and state transition interval are
   negotiated, thus they generate the same tag at the same time.  Time
   triggers state transition which means the ACS MUST synchronize the
   time to the same time base using like NTP defined in [RFC5905].

   For the tag generation method, it MUST be to specify the initial
   state and initial state length of the state machine, the identifier
   of a state machine, state transition interval, length of generated
   Tag, and Tag. For the SA, they will transfer all these payloads in a
   secure channel between ACS and ASBRs, for instance, in ESP [RFC4303].
   It is RECOMMENDED to transfer the tags rather than the SA for
   security and efficiency considerations.  The initial state and its
   length can be specified at the Key Exchange Payload with nothing to
   be changed.  The state machine identifier is the SPI value as the SPI
   value is uniquely in RISAV.  The state transition interval and length
   of generated Tag should be negotiated by the pair ACS, which will
   need to allocate one SA attribute.  The generated Tag will be sent
   from ACS to ASBR in a secure channel which MAY be, for example, ESP
   [RFC4303].

5.3.  Static Negotiation

   The use of IKEv2 between ASes might be fragile, and creates a number
   of potential race conditions (e.g. if the RPKI database contents
   change during the handshake).  It is also potentially costly to
   implement, requiring O(N^2) network activity for N participating
   ASes.  If these challenges prove significant, one alternative would
   be to perform the handshake statically via the RPKI database.  For
   example, static-static ECDH [RFC6278] would allow ASes to agree on
   shared secrets simply by syncing the RPKI database.

   Static negotiation makes endpoints nearly stateless, which simplifies
   the provisioning of ASBRs.  However, it requires inventing a novel
   IPsec negotiation system, so it seems best to try a design using
   IKEv2 first.

6.  Security Consideration

6.1.  Threat models

   In general, RISAV seeks to provide a strong defense against arbitrary
   active attackers who are external to the source and destination ASes.
   However, different RISAV modes and configurations offer different
   security properties.

6.1.1.  Replay attacks

   In Transport Mode, off-path attackers cannot spoof the source IPs of
   a participating AS, but any attacker with access to valid traffic can
   replay it (from anywhere), potentially enabling DoS attacks by
   replaying expensive traffic (e.g.  TCP SYNs, QUIC Initials).  ASes
   that wish to have replay defense, and are willing to pay the extra
   data-plane costs, should prefer tunnel mode.

6.1.2.  Downgrade attacks

   An on-path attacker between two participating ASes could attempt to
   defeat RISAV by blocking IKEv2 handshakes to the Contact IP of a
   target AS.  If the AS initiating the handshake falls back to non-
   RISAV behavior after a handshake failure, this enables the attacker
   to remove all RISAV protection.

   This vulnerable behavior is required when the "testing" flag is set,
   but is otherwise discouraged.

6.2.  Incremental benefit from partial deployment

   RISAV provides significant security benefits even if it is only
   deployed by a fraction of all ASes.  This is particularly clear in
   the context of reflection attacks.  If two networks implement RISAV,
   no one in any other network can trigger a reflection attack between
   these two networks.  Thus, if X% of ASes (selected at random)
   implement RISAV, participating ASes should see an X% reduction in
   reflection attack traffic volume.

6.3.  Compatibility

6.3.1.  With end-to-end IPsec

   When RISAV is used in transport mode, there is a risk of confusion
   between the RISAV AH header and end-to-end AH headers used by
   applications.  This risk is particularly clear during transition
   periods, when the recipient is not sure whether the sender is using
   RISAV or not.

   To avoid any such confusion, RISAV's transport mode uses a
   specialized RISAV-AH header.  (In tunnel mode, no such confusion is
   possible.)

6.3.2.  With other SAV mechanisms

   RISAV is independent from intra-domain SAV and access-layer SAV, such
   as [RFC8704] or SAVI [RFC7039].  When these techniques are used
   together, intra-domain and access-layer SAV checks MUST be enforced
   before applying RISAV.

7.  Operational Considerations

7.1.  Reliability

   The ACS, represented by a contact IP, must be a high-availability,
   high-performance service to avoid outages.  This might be achieved by
   electing one distinguished ASBR as the ACS.  The distinguished ASBR
   acting as an ACS will represent the whole AS to communicate with peer
   AS's ACS.  This election takes place prior to the IKE negotiation.
   In this arrangement, an ASBR MUST be a BGP speaker before it is
   elected as the distinguished ASBR.

7.2.  Synchronizing Multiple ASBRs

   In RISAV, all ASBRs of each AS must have the same Security
   Associations, because the recipient does not keep distinct state for
   each sending ASBR (except for the replay window in tunnel mode).  For
   example, ASBRs cannot perform IKE negotiation independently.
   Instead, the ACS is the entity that represents the AS to negotiate
   associations with other ASes.

   To ensure coherent behavior across the AS, the ACS MUST deliver each
   SA to all ASBRs in the AS immediately after it is negotiated.  RISAV
   does not standardize a mechanism for this update broadcast.

   During the SA broadcast, ASBRs will briefly be out of sync.  RISAV
   recommends a grace period to prevent outages during the update
   process.

7.3.  Performance

   RISAV requires participating ASes to perform symmetric cryptography
   on every RISAV-protected packet that they originate or terminate.
   This will require significant additional compute capacity that may
   not be present on existing networks.  However, until most ASes
   actually implement RISAV, the implementation cost for the few that do
   is greatly reduced.  For example, if 5% of networks implement RISAV,
   then participating networks will only need to apply RISAV to 5% of
   their traffic.

   Thanks to broad interest in optimization of IPsec, very high
   performance implementations are already available.  For example, as
   of 2021 an IPsec throughput of 1 Terabit per second was achievable
   using optimized software on a single server [INTEL].

7.4.  MTU

      TODO: Figure out what to say about MTU, PMTUD, etc.  Perhaps an
      MTU probe is required after setup?  Or on an ongoing basis?

7.5.  NAT scenario

   As all the outer IP header should be the unicast IP address, NAT-
   traversal mode is not necessary in inter-AS SAV.

8.  IANA Consideration

   IF APPROVED IANA is requested to add the following entry to the
   Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers registry:

   *  Decimal: $TBD

   *  Keyword: RISAV-AH

   *  Protocol: AS-to-AS Authentication Header

   *  IPv6 Extension Header: Y

   *  Refrence: (This document)
