An RPKI and IPsec-based AS-to-AS Approach for Source Address Validation
                         draft-xu-risav-latest

Abstract

   This document identifies a need for static-static ECDH, RPKI, and
   IPsec based AS-to-AS approach for detection and mitigation of inter-
   AS source address validation (RISAV).  The RISAV aims to reusing
   existing protocols to provide a light-weight packet's tag and with
   the incremental deployability to significantly reduce the spoofed
   source address in the Internet.

1.  Introduction

   Source address spoofing has been identified years ago at [RFC2827],
   and [RFC5210] has proposed an Source Address Validation Architecture
   (SAVA) to alleviate such concerns.  SAVA classifies this solution
   into three layers: Access Network, Intra-AS, and Inter-AS.  The
   Inter-AS concerns the SAV at the AS boundaries.  It is more
   challenging for developing the inter-AS source address validation
   approach because different ASes run different policies in different
   ISPs independently.  It requires the different ASes to collaborate to
   verify the source address.  The inter-AS SAV is more effective than
   Access or Intra-AS due to its better cost-effectiveness.  However,
   over years of effort, inter-AS source address validation deployment
   is still not optimistic.  An important reason is the difficulty of
   balancing the clear security benefits of partial implementations with
   the scalability of large-scale deployments. uRPF [RFC5635] [RFC8704],
   for example, is a routing-based schemes filter spoofing source
   address's traffic, which may result in a lack of security benefits
   due to the dynamic nature of routing or incomplete information caused
   by partial deployments.

   This document provides a static-static ECDH [RFC6278], RPKI [RFC6480]
   and IPsec-based [RFC4301] inter-AS approach to source address
   validation (RISAV).  RISAV is a cryptography-based SAV mechanism to
   reduce the spoofing source address.  It combines static-static ECDH
   (Elliptic Curve Diffie--Hellman key Exchange), RPKI (Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure), and IPsec (IP Security).  RPKI provides the
   reflection relationship between AS numbers (ASN) and IP prefixes.
   ECDH negotiates between two ASes with the Security Association (SA)
   which contains the algorithm, secret key generating material, and
   IPsec packet type, and so forth.  IPsec is designed for secure the
   Internet at the IP layer.  It introduces two protocols, one is AH
   (authentication header) [RFC4302] which provides authenticity of the
   whole packet, including the source address.  The other is ESP (IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload) [RFC4303] which encrypts the whole
   packet's payload.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Overview

   The goal of this section is to provides the high level description of
   what RISAV is and how RISAV works.

2.1.  What RISAV Is

   RISAV is a cryptographically-based inter-AS source address validation
   approach that guarantees security benefits at partial deployment.  It
   aims to provide the IP datagram with a valid source address, with the
   capability of anti-spoofing, anti-replay, light-weight and efficient,
   and incremental deployment incentives.  As a result, RISAV adds a tag
   to a packet at the source AS Border Router (ASBR) proving that the
   packet is with a valid source address, and it would verify and remove
   this tag at the destination ASBR.  The tag will be encapsulated in
   the Integrity Check Value (ICV) field of IPsec AH/ESP.

2.2.  How RISAV Works

   RISAV uses static-static ECDH as an alternative of IKE [RFC8247] to
   negotiate the security association (SA) used in IPsec AH/ESP
   communications.  Otherwise, it MUST follow strictly the standard IKE
   process to negotiate IKE SA and IPsec SA.  RPKI obtains the binding
   relationship between AS numbers and IP prefixes, and it will
   synchronize the public key generated by ECDH and other messages
   including the contact IP to all peers.  And the original IPsec AH/ESP
   header format is used in communication to carry this tag.  The
   transport mode of IPsec AH is applied in general.

   Before deploying RISAV, each AS sets a contact IP representative.
   When negotiating or consulting with one AS, the peer MUST first
   communicate with this contact IP.  This contact IP should contain at
   least and at most two IPs: one is IPv4 and the other is IPv6.  In
   short, these are referred to as contact IP below.

   A typical workflow of RISAV is shown in Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: RISAV workflow example.

   1.  RPKI process.  The five Reginal Internet Registry (RIR) would be
       authorized by IANA.  They use their root certificate to sign the
       Certificate Authority (CA) certificate of the Local Internet
       Registry (LIR).  And after that LIR would use a CA certificate to
       authorize indirectly the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or
       directly the Autonomous System (AS).  When they obtain their own
       CA certificate, the AS would sign an End Entity (EE) certificate
       with a Route Origin Authorisation (ROA) which is a
       cryptographically signed object that states which AS are
       authorized to originate a certain prefix.  Such the reflection of
       the ASN relationship with IP prefixes would be broadcast to the
       network.  This is the prerequisite.

   2.  ECDH key exchange.  The two deployed ASes MUST carry out the ECDH
       procedure to exchange public key and store the secretly private
       key with each contact IP.  Then the AS encapsulates its public
       key in PKCS#10 syntax [RFC2986] to request a CA certificate with
       its contact IP.  The contact IP will also be reserved at the
       relative CA certificate issued to one AS.  After this exchange
       process, the AS pair negotiate immediately the algorithm, the
       IPsec header type, the session key and other fields at the
       Security Association Database (SAD).

   3.  ASBR EE certificate signing.  The ASBR would need its own EE
       certificate for and only for generating and verifying the ICV
       field in the AH/ESP header.  This EE certificate is REQUIRED like
       the BGPsec Router Certificate defined in [RFC8209].  But the key
       used in generating the ICV value is not directly using this ECDH
       key pair.  The key will be generated at the step 4 next.  Since
       the ASBR is the main entity that processes the tag in the packet,
       it MUST be clear that all ASBRs of the same AS at the same time
       should apply the same key to calculate the ICV value.  Thus, this
       will eliminate the multipath problems, which will be discussed in
       Section 5.1.

   4.  RPKI and information synchronization.  The ROA synchronization
       would take place after the RPKI is deployed as step 1 describes.
       Here it will synchronize the contact IP in the RPKI database.
       That means the contact IP should be an exposed-available, high-
       performance IP address.  After syncrhonization, the ASBR would
       get the IP address of the contact IP.  The ASBR also requires
       that the synchronization includes the session key and other
       things negotiated at the step 2 used in the IPsec communication.

   5.  SA negotiation and delivery.  This is an OPTIONAL operation only
       if the AS doesn't support static-static ECDH.  Before IPsec is
       established, the SA must be reached an agreement.  There are two
       ways to negotiate the SA in traditional IPsec.  One is manually
       config all the parameters and the other one is using IKE for
       dynamic negotiating these parameters.  Currently used is IKE
       version 2 (IKEv2, for short using IKE below).  Typically, IKE
       would produce IKE SA in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange and IPsec SA in
       the IKE_AUTH exchange.  This will be done at the entity that owns
       and uses the contact IP, i.e. IKE node should be the node with
       the contact IP.  When all negotiations are done, the IPsec is
       established.

   6.  IPsec communication.  It uses IPsec AH for authentication of the
       IP source address by default.  IPsec is often used in tunnel mode
       as the IPsec VPN.  Here, It expands the gateway to the ASBR.
       When two ends x and y in AS A and B respectively are
       communicating, the packet from x arriving at its ASBR RA would
       use the established IPsec channel for adding the representative
       tag which is generated with the negotiated and synchronized
       algorithm, session key, IPsec type, and other items and is filled
       in the ICV field.  After the packet arrives at ASBR RB of AS B,
       it would be inspected by comparing the consistency of the tag at
       the packet's ICV field and the tag generated in the same way at
       the source ASBR.

3.  Control Plane

   The functions of the control plane of RISAV include ASN-Prefix
   relationship announcement, Tag management, and ASN-Tag relationship
   announcement.

3.1.  ASN-Prefix relationship announcement

   RISAV uses RPKI to manage the relationship between ASN and IP
   prefixes.  So when one AS wants to deploy RISAV, it should implement
   RPKI first.  When RPKI is deployed, the validated ROA cache SHOULD be
   sent to the ASBR for routing and forwarding packets.

   The ROA whose status is valid can be used with IPsec to prevent
   source address spoofing.  That means only the prefix contained in
   valid ROA would valuably and correctly be protected.

   For more information about RPKI, one can refer to [RFC6480].

3.2.  Tag management

   Before introducing the ASN-Tag relationship announcement, it shall be
   described what is a tag and how it is generated.

   A tag is a variable bit-string that is generated at an entity in AS.
   This entity is AS Control Server (ACS).  The tag is used with the
   authentication algorithm to generate the signature.  That means the
   tag is the key to the authentication.  When communicating, the tag
   would not be directly tagged to the IPsec AH of the packet, replacing
   it with a signature instead, which will be different with different
   packets.  One AS SHOULD have at most two tags in effect in the same
   bound simultaneously for Key-Rover.

   It has two ways for an ACS to generate tags.  One is using a state
   machine.  The state machine runs and triggers the state transition
   when time is up.  The tag is generated in the process of state
   transition as the side product.  The two ACS in peer AS respectively
   before data transmission will maintain one state machine pair for
   each bound.  The state machine runs simultaneously after the initial
   state, state transition algorithm, and state transition interval are
   negotiated, thus they generate the same tag at the same time.  Time
   triggers state transition which means the ACS MUST synchronize the
   time to the same time base using like NTP defined in [RFC5905].

   The other way to generate a tag is by applying the original SA.  The
   IPsec channel is established when the IKE_AUTH process is finished.
   SA includes the specified AH, the authentication algorithm, the key
   used for authentication, etc.  So two IKE entities have negotiated
   SA.  All ASBR in one AS SHOULD use the same SA.

   When it chooses to use a logical ACS, one AS will elect one
   distinguished ASBR as the ACS.  The distinguished ASBR acting as an
   ACS will represent the whole AS to communicate with peer AS's ACS.
   This election takes place prior to the IKE negotiation.  An ASBR MUST
   be a BGP speaker before it is elected as the distinguished ASBR.
   This is an OPTIONAL operation to use this logical ACS.

3.3.  ASN-Tag relationship announcement

   Corresponding to the tag generating, it also has two ways to announce
   the ASN-Tag binding relationship.  The first is to deliver the
   generated tags and the second is to deliver the original SA.

   Thus, there must be a header format definition to transfer these tags
   and SA.  In RISAV, it uses the header and payload formats defined in
   [RFC5996].  Meanwhile, there are some almost negligible changes to
   the formats.  For the tag generation method, it MUST be to specify
   the initial state and initial state length of the state machine, the
   identifier of a state machine, state transition interval, length of
   generated Tag, and Tag. For the SA, they will transfer all these
   payloads in a secure channel between ACS and ASBRs, for instance, in
   ESP [RFC4303].  It is RECOMMENDED to transfer the tags rather than
   the SA for security and efficiency considerations.  The initial state
   and its length can be specified at the Key Exchange Payload with
   nothing to be changed.  The state machine identifier is the SPI value
   as the SPI value is uniquely in RISAV.  The state transition interval
   and length of generated Tag should be negotiated by the pair ACS,
   which will need to allocate one SA attribute.  The generated Tag will
   be sent from ACS to ASBR in a secure channel which MAY be, for
   example, ESP [RFC4303].

4.  Data Plane

   The functions of the data plane of RISAV include source address
   checking and tag processing.

   RISAV redesign the original AH format as shown in Figure 2.

                         Figure 2: RISAV AH Format.

   Prefix Length:  The prefix length in valid ROA matched the IP source
      address.  It presents the valid length of the IP source address
      prefix.

   SIG Length:  The length of the variable signature.  It is the octets
      in Signature.

   Signature:  The result of the authentication algorithm with the key.

   All the ASBRs of the AS are REQUIRED to enable RISAV.  And RISAV can
   OPTIONAL cooperate with intra-domain SAV and access-layer SAV, such
   as [RFC8704] or SAVI [RFC7039].  Only when intra-domain or access-
   layer SAV, if deployed, check passed can the packet process and
   forward correctly.  It uses SPI for destination ASBR to locate the SA
   uniquely when processing the AH header in RISAV.

   As defined in [RFC4301], the Security Association Database (SAD)
   stores all the SAs.  One data item in SAD includes an Authentication
   algorithm and corresponding key when AH is supported.  The
   authentication algorithm could be HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, or others.
   As authenticating the whole packet causes a heavy burden in the
   computation, RISAV defines that it only authenticates the IP source
   address, IP destination address, and the IP prefix length in ROA,
   SPI, and Sequence Number Field.  The eventual signature is the hash
   of the 5-tuple before with the key/tag.

   When a packet arrives at the source ASBR, it will be checked with the
   destination address by this ASBR first.  If the destination address
   is in the protection range of RISAV, the packet will be checked by
   the source address next.  If the source address belongs to the AS in
   which the ASBR locates, the packet needs to be filled in the AH
   header.

   When a packet arrives at the destination ASBR, it will be checked the
   destination address and the source address orderly.  If the
   destination belongs to the AS that the destination ASBR locates in
   and the source address seats in the RISAV protection area, the packet
   needs to be inspected with the AH header.

4.1.  Incremental deployment

   So far, IPsec is often used as a VPN which is a technology for
   private network access through public networks.  In the final
   analysis, IPsec is a highly cost-effective ratio mechanism.  Original
   IPsec AH needs to authenticate the whole constant part of a packet so
   that it needs to spend amounts of time finding and processing
   unchangeable fields in the packet.  However, RISAV only needs to find
   a few changeless fields to authenticate the packet decreasing the
   cost dramatically.

5.  Security Consideration

5.1.  Multipath Problem

5.2.  Compatibility

   When using RISAV, it WOULD be used at last when all other IPsec SA
   does not match.  Such that, RISAV is comparable with the current
   IPsec Security Architecture.  It SHOULD be guaranteed that the
   preference of RISAV is lower than other IPsec.  So it may require the
   special SPI filled.

5.3.  Key Guessing and Cracking

   For resisting label-based reply attacks, the eventual signature used
   in a packet is generated by the ASBR by hashing a few fields
   including the IP source address, IP destination address, and the IP
   prefix length in ROA, SPI, and Sequence Number Field.  The attacker
   could guess the signature and crack that key using brute force.
   Nevertheless, it depends on the irreversibility of a hash function to
