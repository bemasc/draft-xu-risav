An RPKI and IPsec-based AS-to-AS Approach for Source Address Validation
                         draft-xu-risav-latest

Abstract

   This document presents RISAV, a protocol for establishing and using
   IPsec security between Autonomous Systems (ASes) using the RPKI
   identity system.  In this protocol, the originating AS adds
   authenticating information to each outgoing packet at its Border
   Routers (ASBRs), and the receiving AS verifies and strips this
   information at its ASBRs.  Packets that fail validation are dropped
   by the ASBR.  RISAV achieves Source Address Validation among all
   participating ASes.

1.  Introduction

   Source address spoofing has been identified years ago at [RFC2827],
   and [RFC5210] has proposed an Source Address Validation Architecture
   (SAVA) to alleviate such concerns.  SAVA classifies this solution
   into three layers: Access Network, Intra-AS, and Inter-AS.  The
   Inter-AS concerns the SAV at the AS boundaries.  It is more
   challenging for developing the inter-AS source address validation
   approach because different ASes run different policies in different
   ISPs independently.  It requires the different ASes to collaborate to
   verify the source address.  The inter-AS SAV is more effective than
   Access or Intra-AS due to its better cost-effectiveness.  However,
   over years of effort, inter-AS source address validation deployment
   is still not optimistic.  An important reason is the difficulty of
   balancing the clear security benefits of partial implementations with
   the scalability of large-scale deployments. uRPF [RFC5635] [RFC8704],
   for example, is a routing-based schemes filter spoofing source
   address's traffic, which may result in a lack of security benefits
   due to the dynamic nature of routing or incomplete information caused
   by partial deployments.

   This document provides a static-static ECDH, RPKI and IPsec-based
   [RFC4301] inter-AS approach to source address validation (RISAV).
   RISAV is a cryptography-based SAV mechanism to reduce the spoofing
   source address.  It combines static-static ECDH (Elliptic Curve
   Diffie--Hellman key Exchange), RPKI (Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure), and IPsec (IP Security).  RPKI provides the
   reflection relationship between AS numbers (ASN) and IP prefixes.
   ECDH negotiates between two ASes with the Security Association (SA)
   which contains the algorithm, secret key generating material, and
   IPsec packet type, and so forth.  IPsec is designed for secure the
   Internet at the IP layer.  It introduces two protocols, one is AH
   (authentication header) [RFC4302] which provides authenticity of the
   whole packet, including the source address.  The other is ESP (IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload) [RFC4303] which encrypts the whole
   packet's payload.

   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Overview

   The goal of this section is to provides the high level description of
   how RISAV works.  RISAV is a cryptography-b ased inter-AS source
   address validation method that guarantees security benefits at
   partial deployment.  RISAV uses static-static ECDH 1.  RPKI process.
   The five Reginal Internet Registry (RIR) would be authorized by IANA.
   They use their root certificate to sign the Certificate Authority
   (CA) certificate of the Local Internet Registry (LIR).  And after
   that LIR would use a CA certificate to authorize indirectly the
   Internet Service Provider (ISP) or directly the Autonomous System
   (AS).  When they obtain their own CA certificate, the AS would sign
   an End Entity (EE) certificate with a Route Origin Authorisation
   (ROA) which is a cryptographically signed object that states which AS
   are authorized to originate a certain prefix.  Such the reflection of
   ASN relationship with IP prefixes would be broadcast to the network.

   1.  Sign ASBR EE certificate.  This EE certificate is just like the
       BGPsec Router Certificate defined in [RFC8209].  The ASBR would
       need its own EE certificate for and only for generating and
       verifying the signature in the AH header directly or indirectly.

   2.  IKE process.  Before IPsec establishing, the SA must be reached
       an agreement.  There are two ways to negotiate the SA.  One is
       mutual config all the parameters and the other one is using IKE
       for dynamic negotiating these parameters.  Currently used is IKE
       version 2 (IKEv2, for short using IKE below).  Typically, IKE
       would produce IKE SA in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange and IPsec SA in
       the IKE_AUTH exchange.  This will be done in an ACS.

   3.  SA or tag delivery.  When all negotiations are done, the IPsec is
       established.  If the ACS is an ASBR actually, it would deliver SA
       to the other ASBR in this AS.  Otherwise, it would deliver the
       tags generated by the state machine.  This delivery will be
       processed in a secure channel just like using IPsec ESP.

   4.  IPsec AH communication.  It uses IPsec AH for authentication of
       the IP source address.  IPsec is often used in tunnel mode as the
       IPsec VPN.  Here, It expands the gateway to the AS border router
       (ASBR).  When two ends x and y in AS X and Y respectively are
       communicating, the packet from x arriving at its ASBR RA would
       use the established IPsec channel for adding the representative
       tag.  After the packet arrives at ASBR RB of AS Y, it would be
       inspected by comparing the consistency of the tag.  The tag will
       be encapsulated in the ICV field in AH.

   A typical workflow of RISAV is shown in Figure 1.

3.  Control Plane

   The functions of the control plane of RISAV include ASN-Prefix
   relationship announcement, Tag management, and ASN-Tag relationship
   announcement.

3.1.  ASN-Prefix relationship announcement

   RISAV uses RPKI to manage the relationship between ASN and IP
   prefixes.  So when one AS wants to deploy RISAV, it should implement
   RPKI first.  When RPKI is deployed, the validated ROA cache SHOULD be
   sent to the ASBR for routing and forwarding packets.

   The ROA whose status is valid can be used with IPsec to prevent
   source address spoofing.  That means only the prefix contained in
   valid ROA would valuably and correctly be protected.

   For more information about RPKI, one can refer to [RFC6480].

3.2.  Tag management

   Before introducing the ASN-Tag relationship announcement, it shall be
   described what is a tag and how it is generated.

   A tag is a variable bit-string that is generated at an entity in AS.
   This entity is AS Control Server (ACS).  The tag is used with the
   authentication algorithm to generate the signature.  That means the
   tag is the key to the authentication.  When communicating, the tag
   would not be directly tagged to the IPsec AH of the packet, replacing
   it with a signature instead, which will be different with different
   packets.  One AS SHOULD have at most two tags in effect in the same
   bound simultaneously for Key-Rover.

   It has two ways for an ACS to generate tags.  One is using a state
   machine.  The state machine runs and triggers the state transition
   when time is up.  The tag is generated in the process of state
   transition as the side product.  The two ACS in peer AS respectively
   before data transmission will maintain one state machine pair for
   each bound.  The state machine runs simultaneously after the initial
   state, state transition algorithm, and state transition interval are
   negotiated, thus they generate the same tag at the same time.  Time
   triggers state transition which means the ACS MUST synchronize the
   time to the same time base using like NTP defined in [RFC5905].

   The other way to generate a tag is by applying the original SA.  The
   IPsec channel is established when the IKE_AUTH process is finished.
   SA includes the specified AH, the authentication algorithm, the key
   used for authentication, etc.  So two IKE entities have negotiated
   SA.  All ASBR in one AS SHOULD use the same SA.

   When it chooses to use a logical ACS, one AS will elect one
   distinguished ASBR as the ACS.  The distinguished ASBR acting as an
   ACS will represent the whole AS to communicate with peer AS's ACS.
   This election takes place prior to the IKE negotiation.  An ASBR MUST
   be a BGP speaker before it is elected as the distinguished ASBR.
   This is an OPTIONAL operation to use this logical ACS.

3.3.  ASN-Tag relationship announcement

   Corresponding to the tag generating, it also has two ways to announce
   the ASN-Tag binding relationship.  The first is to deliver the
   generated tags and the second is to deliver the original SA.

   Thus, there must be a header format definition to transfer these tags
   and SA.  In RISAV, it uses the header and payload formats defined in
   [RFC5996].  Meanwhile, there are some almost negligible changes to
   the formats.  For the tag generation method, it MUST be to specify
   the initial state and initial state length of the state machine, the
   identifier of a state machine, state transition interval, length of
   generated Tag, and Tag. For the SA, they will transfer all these
   payloads in a secure channel between ACS and ASBRs, for instance, in
   ESP [RFC4303].  It is RECOMMENDED to transfer the tags rather than
   the SA for security and efficiency considerations.  The initial state
   and its length can be specified at the Key Exchange Payload with
   nothing to be changed.  The state machine identifier is the SPI value
   as the SPI value is uniquely in RISAV.  The state transition interval
   and length of generated Tag should be negotiated by the pair ACS,
   which will need to allocate one SA attribute.  The generated Tag will
   be sent from ACS to ASBR in a secure channel which MAY be, for
   example, ESP [RFC4303].

4.  Data Plane

   The functions of the data plane of RISAV include source address
   checking and tag processing.

   RISAV redesign the original AH format as shown in Figure 2.

                         Figure 2: RISAV AH Format.

   Prefix Length:  The prefix length in valid ROA matched the IP source
      address.  It presents the valid length of the IP source address
      prefix.

   SIG Length:  The length of the variable signature.  It is the octets
      in Signature.

   Signature:  The result of the authentication algorithm with the key.

   All the ASBRs of the AS are REQUIRED to enable RISAV.  And RISAV can
   OPTIONAL cooperate with intra-domain SAV and access-layer SAV, such
   as [RFC8704] or SAVI [RFC7039].  Only when intra-domain or access-
   layer SAV, if deployed, check passed can the packet process and
   forward correctly.  It uses SPI for destination ASBR to locate the SA
   uniquely when processing the AH header in RISAV.

   As defined in [RFC4301], the Security Association Database (SAD)
   stores all the SAs.  One data item in SAD includes an Authentication
   algorithm and corresponding key when AH is supported.  The
   authentication algorithm could be HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, or others.
   As authenticating the whole packet causes a heavy burden in the
   computation, RISAV defines that it only authenticates the IP source
   address, IP destination address, and the IP prefix length in ROA,
   SPI, and Sequence Number Field.  The eventual signature is the hash
   of the 5-tuple before with the key/tag.

   When a packet arrives at the source ASBR, it will be checked with the
   destination address by this ASBR first.  If the destination address
   is in the protection range of RISAV, the packet will be checked by
   the source address next.  If the source address belongs to the AS in
   which the ASBR locates, the packet needs to be filled in the AH
   header.

   When a packet arrives at the destination ASBR, it will be checked the
   destination address and the source address orderly.  If the
   destination belongs to the AS that the destination ASBR locates in
   and the source address seats in the RISAV protection area, the packet
   needs to be inspected with the AH header.

4.1.  Incremental deployment

   So far, IPsec is often used as a VPN which is a technology for
   private network access through public networks.  In the final
   analysis, IPsec is a highly cost-effective ratio mechanism.  Original
   IPsec AH needs to authenticate the whole constant part of a packet so
   that it needs to spend amounts of time finding and processing
   unchangeable fields in the packet.  However, RISAV only needs to find
   a few changeless fields to authenticate the packet decreasing the
   cost dramatically.

5.  Security Consideration

5.1.  Compatibility

   When using RISAV, it WOULD be used at last when all other IPsec SA
   does not match.  Such that, RISAV is comparable with the current
   IPsec Security Architecture.  It SHOULD be guaranteed that the
   preference of RISAV is lower than other IPsec.  So it may require the
   special SPI filled.

5.2.  Key Guessing and Cracking

   For resisting label-based reply attacks, the eventual signature used
   in a packet is generated by the ASBR by hashing a few fields
   including the IP source address, IP destination address, and the IP
   prefix length in ROA, SPI, and Sequence Number Field.  The attacker
   could guess the signature and crack that key using brute force.
   Nevertheless, it depends on the irreversibility of a hash function to
   prevent back stepping the key from the signature.  Furthermore, to
   decrease such probability, the key used in generating the signature
   will be updated periodically.

6.  IANA Consideration

   TBD.
